<h1> Project 2   Timelapse Algomations </h1>

<p> In project 2, I have selected a parametric equation that has variables of x, y, and t. The variables x and y count have axis and also t as speed of timeline loops. According to the design/movement of the loop, I changed and given x and y coordinates according to the created artwork aligned with used pumpkins and balls that had scaling and loops around the canvas. Overall I enjoyed the transition view of showcasing different designs of loops in parametric equations.
