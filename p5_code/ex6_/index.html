  <h1> Exercise 6 </h1>
  
  <p> In this sketch, I’ve included four selectable states. Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 to explore each one. I’ve designed everything with a Christmas theme and incorporated elements from Exercise #6.
  I have added a basic setup of structure includes a tree and various background elements. In all the pages, I have given an option to click that makes sounds for a 1 second and in first page I have given mouse movement of colors of lights changes. 
  The setup features three different sound variations: the first page plays a piano version of "Merry Christmas," the second page features another Christmas song, and the third page includes Santa Claus’ "Ho-ho-ho" sound and fourth page includes piano version of "Merry Christmas. Additionally, I’ve used jingle bell sounds for the buttons. 
  In Exercise #6, I chose a Christmas theme and created three different page states. You can explore each one by pressing the keyboard keys 1, 2, 3, or 4.
