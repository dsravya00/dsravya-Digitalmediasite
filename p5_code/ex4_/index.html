  <h1> Exercise 4: Industrious Code [Arrays, OOP, Vectors and For Loops]</h1>
  <p> In this Exercise 4, I've utilized arrays, object-oriented programming (OOP), vector scaling, and for loops to create a project. I incorporated bouncing balls and displayed two characters while implementing scaling and translation using various shapes. Additionally, I defined the draw function within a variable. In accordance with the requirement for selecting a student's code, I selected a frog design from one of the students and added it to my canvas board. Additionally, I incorporated blinking eyes with mouth of a change. Along with using keyboard can play with sizechange and roation. The composition features pumpkins and a black face, all combined with scaling effects and upward motion, as detailed in Exercise 4.

    <b>Use keyboard = 
     <ul>
        <li>'a' - Rotation</li>
        <li>'b' and 'c' - sizechange (increase & decrease)</li>
     </ul>
