<h1> Exercise 3 </h1>

<p>  In this sketch, I began working with custom functions and translation techniques. I utilized a parental function alongside various transformations, such as rotation and scaling, in my artwork. I incorporated a wrap-around vector for the movement of emojis. The parental function includes three characters: a sunflower, a panda, a pumpkin, and a brown face wearing a hat, accompanied by bees that move and pause for a few seconds before shifting from one side to the other. Each parental and child function is labeled accordingly. I particularly enjoyed exploring the concept of characters, especially watching the bees and giving them their own scale. I spent considerable time on scaling, which required adjustments to position the objects, and Iâ€™m pleased with the final output of this exercise. <br>
