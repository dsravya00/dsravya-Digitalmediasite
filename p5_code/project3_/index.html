<h2>Project 3 - Clock Visualization</h2>
<p>
  For Exercise 5, I designed a visual clock that illustrates my daily activities from 6 AM to 10 PM, capturing how I organize my time throughout the day. I incorporated seconds, minutes, and hours to match my daily routine and included activities that reflect my typical schedule. The clock also features a day and time mode, with water as the central concept. I built on the water drop theme, dividing it into three sections: seconds, minutes, and hours. Each drop represents one second, gradually filling a glass container with water. After 59 seconds, the water is recorded as a minute in a bottle. As the minutes accumulate, they contribute to the total hours stored in a larger container. I also included my activities within specific hourly segments, each reflecting the daily routine I follow.
