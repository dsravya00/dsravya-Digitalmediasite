<h1> Project 4 </h1>


  <p> In this Project 4, I have included four selectable states. Press 1, 2, 3 or 4 to explore each one. I’ve designed everything with a Christmas theme and incorporated elements from Exercise #6.  
  In this, I created a basic setup alogn with given few software mashup version is showcased in Project 4.  
  As a baseline, I have given structure that includes a tree and various background elements. On all the pages, I’ve included an option to click that plays a sound for one second. On the first page, I’ve added a feature where the colors of the lights change with mouse movement. Additionally, I’ve implemented drag-and-drop functionality and mouse movement interactions on both pages 1 and 2.
  With that I have setup features of three different sound variations: the first page plays a piano version of "Merry Christmas," the second page features another Christmas song, and the third page includes Santa Claus’ "Ho-ho-ho" sound and fourth page includes piano version of "Merry Christmas. Additionally, I’ve used jingle bell sounds for the buttons. I have also presented images of Santa Claus and gift boxes on a few pages, which add a festive touch to the design. These images are integrated to enhance the overall theme and create a more engaging user experience.
  The wireframe of my website includes the basic layout and structure of the page, highlighting the placement of elements such as headers, images, text blocks, and buttons. Additionally, it incorporates design details like colors and fonts.
  In Exercise #6, I chose a Christmas theme and created three different page states. You can explore each one by pressing the keyboard keys 1, 2, 3, or 4.
